# Baby Activity Logger for Raspberry Pi
## Description
This python app integrates with Google Calendar to add a calendar event for when your baby eats or sleeps. 

## Pre-requisites
* enable the Google Calendar API on your calendar account and enable access to read, write, and view events of the calendar. 
* save a client secret file from your Google Develop console named "client_secret.json" to the `settings` folder.

The first time you run the app on your Pi (requires WiFi connection), you will need to use a monitor to authenticate the app for that calendar. 

## Parts list
(WIP)
* Raspberry Pi
* Breadboard
* Buttons

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
